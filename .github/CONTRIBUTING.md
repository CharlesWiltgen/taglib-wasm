# Contributing to TagLib-Wasm

Thank you for your interest in contributing to TagLib-Wasm! This document
provides guidelines and instructions for contributing.

## 🤝 Code of Conduct

Be respectful and constructive in all interactions. We're here to build great
software together.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js 24+** - Primary development runtime (Active LTS; matches the CI matrix)
- **pnpm 12+** - The package manager; run `pnpm install` before any `vp` command
- **Deno 2.x** - Needed for the Deno runtime test leg (`pnpm run test:deno`; the Deno arm of `tests/cross-runtime/run.sh`) and for the JSR publish/verify legs (`publish-jsr`, `verify-jsr` in `publish-everywhere.yml`); the build and default gates run on `node`/`pnpm exec tsx`
- **Emscripten SDK** - For building the Emscripten Wasm backend
- **WASI SDK 34** - For building the WASI Wasm backend (optional for TS-only changes)
- **Git** - With submodule support

pnpm installs and locks the project's dependencies (`pnpm-lock.yaml`); npm
remains the registry client (`npm pack`, `npm publish`), the installer for
global CLI tools, and the consumer proxy the verification scripts use when they
simulate an npm consumer in a scratch directory.

### Development Setup

1. **Clone the repository** (includes TagLib, mpack, and msgpack submodules)

   ```bash
   git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/CharlesWiltgen/TagLib-Wasm.git
   cd TagLib-Wasm
   ```

2. **Install Emscripten** (required for Wasm builds)

   ```bash
   # Follow instructions at https://emscripten.org/docs/getting_started/downloads.html
   # Or use brew on macOS:
   brew install emscripten
   ```

3. **Install WASI SDK** (only needed if modifying the WASI backend)

   ```bash
   bash build/setup-wasi-sdk.sh        # Downloads WASI SDK 34 (stock sysroot ships C++ exceptions)
   ```

4. **Build the project**

   ```bash
   pnpm install                  # Install dependencies (Node 24+, pnpm)
   pnpm run build:wasm            # Rebuild both Wasm backends
   pnpm run build:wasm:emscripten # Rebuild Emscripten Wasm only
   pnpm run build:wasm:wasi       # Rebuild WASI Wasm only
   ```

   > After changing `lib/taglib` or `src/capi/`, rebuild **both** backends and
   > commit both binaries. They are committed artifacts, and shipping one built
   > from a different TagLib than the other is a silent cross-backend skew. CI's
   > `wasm-freshness` job fails a commit that moves `lib/taglib` without them.

5. **Run the pre-push gates**

   ```bash
   pnpm run check:all                            # every gate, in one command
   pnpm exec vp check                            # format + lint gates
   pnpm exec tsc --noEmit -p tsconfig.check.json # type gate (tests included)
   pnpm exec vp test                             # tests (Vitest)
   pnpm run build:ts                             # bundle gate (bundler-resolution check)
   ```

   > `pnpm run check:all` is the authoritative gate set — it adds ast-grep, docs
   > coverage, knip, the emitted-tree guards and the toolchain pins on top of the
   > five above. `pnpm exec vpr static` is the cached commit-time subset (format
   >
   > - lint).
   >   `pnpm install` must run before any `pnpm exec vp` command — `vp` loads
   >   `vite.config.ts` strictly and aborts without the `vite-plus`
   >   devDependency. `pnpm exec vp test` is a **Vite+ built-in**, not the
   >   project's `test` script (run that one with `pnpm exec vpr test`). Deno is
   >   not required for the build or the default gates: the bundles are produced
   >   by `vp pack` (configured in `vite.config.ts`), `scripts/postbuild.mjs`
   >   runs under `node` and the auxiliary `.ts` scripts under `pnpm exec tsx`.
   >   Deno is still needed for the Deno runtime test leg
   >   (`pnpm run test:deno`) and the JSR publish leg.
   >   `pnpm run build:ts` builds the
   >   shippable bundles and catches bundler-resolution breaks (e.g. an import that
   >   isn't an npm dependency) that pass the tests but break the published package.

## 📝 Development Guidelines

### Code Style

- **TypeScript**: Strict mode enabled, no `any` types without justification
- **Formatting**: Use the Vite+ formatter (`pnpm exec vp fmt` to fix, `pnpm exec vp fmt --check` to verify)
- **Linting**: Pass `pnpm exec vp lint --type-aware`
- **Comments**: JSDoc for all public APIs

### Project Structure

```
TagLib-Wasm/
├── src/            # TypeScript source (core runtime, types, errors)
│   ├── index.ts    # Full API entry point        ┐ the public entry
│   ├── simple.ts   # Simple API entry point      │ barrels: one per
│   ├── folder.ts   # Folder API entry point      │ published subpath
│   ├── web.ts, rating.ts, disc-folder.ts, *.browser.ts
│   ├── capi/       # C/C++ binding layer (Wasm shim, MessagePack, boundary)
│   └── runtime/    # WASI host implementation
├── build/          # Build scripts (Emscripten + WASI)

```

`dist/` mirrors `src/` one-for-one: `src/index.ts` → `dist/index.js` +
`dist/index.d.ts`, and so on. The entry barrels live in `src/` precisely so
that holds — a source file outside `src/` in a pack entry list raises the
entry base to the repo root and nests everything under `dist/src/`.

### Key Files

- `build/taglib_embind.cpp` - Emscripten C++ wrapper using Embind
- `src/capi/taglib_shim.cpp` - WASI C++ shim (FileRef-based)
- `src/capi/core/taglib_boundary.c` - Pure C WASI exports
- `src/taglib.ts` - Core TypeScript API
- `src/simple.ts` - Simple API entry point
- `tests/index.test.ts` - Main test suite

## 🧪 Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Tests (Vitest): 97 files across tests/ and src/
pnpm exec vp test

# Watch mode
pnpm exec vp test --watch

# Run a specific test file
pnpm exec vp test tests/basic-tags.test.ts

# The bun:test-registered integration file, the Deno-gated tests and the
# cross-runtime suite are excluded from the Vitest gate; run them separately:
pnpm run test:bun
pnpm run test:deno
bash tests/cross-runtime/run.sh
```

### Writing Tests

- Import `describe`/`it`/`expect` from **`vite-plus/test`** (not `vitest`)
- Use `tests/_assert-helpers.ts` for the assertion strengths Vitest's built-ins
  do not cover (`expectDefined`, `expectThrows`, `expectRejects`)
- Place tests in `tests/` directory
- Follow existing test patterns
- Test both success and error cases
- Include edge cases for new features

Example test:

```typescript
import { describe, expect, it } from "vite-plus/test";

describe("Feature", () => {
  it("description", async () => {
    const taglib = await TagLib.initialize();
    const audioFile = await taglib.open(testFile);
    try {
      // Test your feature
      expect(result).toStrictEqual(expected);
    } finally {
      audioFile.dispose();
    }
  });
});
```

## 💻 Making Changes

### Workflow

1. **Fork the repository**
2. **Create a feature branch**

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feat/your-feature-name
   # or
   git checkout -b fix/issue-description
   ```

3. **Make your changes**
   - Write code following the style guide
   - Add tests for new functionality
   - Update documentation as needed

4. **Test your changes**

   ```bash
   pnpm exec vp fmt --check                      # format gate (`pnpm exec vp fmt` fixes)
   pnpm exec vp lint --type-aware                # lint gate
   pnpm exec tsc --noEmit -p tsconfig.check.json # type gate (tests included)
   pnpm exec vp test                             # tests (Vitest)
   pnpm run build:ts                             # bundle gate (bundler-resolution check)
   ```

   > `pnpm exec vp test` runs the Vitest suite; `pnpm run test:bun` runs the
   > bun:test-registered file, `pnpm run test:deno` the Deno-gated tests, and
   > `tests/cross-runtime/run.sh` the cross-runtime suite. `pnpm install` must
   > precede every `pnpm exec vp` command
   > (`vp` loads `vite.config.ts` strictly). `pnpm run build:ts` builds the
   > shippable bundles and catches bundler-resolution breaks (e.g. an import
   > that isn't an npm dependency) that pass the tests but break the published
   > package.

## 🔧 Building WebAssembly

The project has two Wasm backends:

| Backend    | Script                           | Used by           | C++ entry point            |
| ---------- | -------------------------------- | ----------------- | -------------------------- |
| Emscripten | `pnpm run build:wasm:emscripten` | Browsers, Workers | `build/taglib_embind.cpp`  |
| WASI       | `pnpm run build:wasm:wasi`       | Deno, Node.js     | `src/capi/taglib_shim.cpp` |

After C++ changes, rebuild the affected backend and test thoroughly.

### C++ Guidelines

- All C++ files **must** use `-fwasm-exceptions` (not `-fexceptions`) for consistent EH
- The WASI boundary layer (`taglib_boundary.c`) is pure C — keep it that way
- Validate all inputs from JavaScript/TypeScript side
- C++ stdlib constructs (`std::string`, `thread_local`, `std::vector`) generate Itanium EH symbols (`__cxa_*`) even under `-fwasm-exceptions` — keep boundary code to C types

## 🔄 Updating TagLib

TagLib is a git submodule at `lib/taglib/`. To update:

```bash
cd lib/taglib
git fetch --tags
git checkout v2.2.1  # or desired version
cd ../..
git add lib/taglib
git commit -m "chore: update TagLib to v2.2.1"
```

## 🚀 Releasing

Releases are cut from `main` with one command:

```bash
pnpm run release                # auto-increment patch version
pnpm run release -- 2.4.0       # explicit version (pnpm accepts `--` and strips it)
pnpm run release:quick -- 2.4.0 # same gates and same flow, but do not wait for the result
```

`scripts/release-safe.sh` runs the gates, bumps the version, pushes the bump
commit, **waits for CI to pass on that commit**, verifies the npm publish path
(`scripts/check-publish-access.sh`), and then dispatches
`publish-everywhere.yml` and waits for the result.

That workflow builds the package, publishes npm → GitHub Packages, and —
**only once every registry has the version** — creates the tag and the GitHub
release, with notes taken from the CHANGELOG section for that version. Nothing
is tagged before the release is real, so a failed publish leg cannot leave a
released-but-unpublished version. The tag points at the commit the workflow
built, not at whatever `main` happens to be when the run finishes.

Before that tag exists, `finalize` verifies **the artifact that was actually
published**: `scripts/verify-published.mjs` installs the version from the
registry and reads a real tag on **both** wasm backends (plus the Wasm-free
`disc-folder` subpath). A stale committed binary, or a tarball whose wrapper
does not match, fails there — and no tag and no release are created. Run it
against any released version locally with
`pnpm run verify:published -- <version>`.

A manually created GitHub release still triggers the same workflow
(`on: release: types: [published]`), which is the escape hatch if you need to
publish from a release object someone else created. Use
`pnpm run release:quick -- <version>` (equivalent to `SKIP_PUBLISH_WATCH=1`) to
dispatch without waiting — the gates and the publish flow are identical.

### npm authentication

There is no publish token. The npm leg uses OIDC trusted publishing, authorized
by a per-package trusted-publisher entry that pins the repository **and the
workflow filename**. If the entry is missing or names something else, the npm
leg fails. Check it before releasing:

```bash
scripts/check-publish-access.sh
```

Reading trust configs needs `npm login --auth-type=web` plus a fresh browser 2FA
approval, which is why this is a preflight step rather than a CI gate.
`release-safe.sh` runs it automatically and refuses to continue on a definitive
failure.

That entry currently pins the repository and workflow filename only. A GitHub
Environment with required reviewers — which would make an _approved_ publish,
rather than repository write access, the thing that grants publish rights — is
prepared but **not landed**; the three-step sequence, the npm-side command, and
the reason it is gated are recorded with the release work. When it lands, every `npm trust github` command here and in the
recovery section below needs `--env release` added.

### Recovering a release

Nothing is tagged or released until every registry has the version, so a failure
means a clean retry rather than a half-published version:

1. **Partial publish** (some registries lack the version) — re-run the failed
   legs of the same run:

   ```bash
   gh run rerun <run-id> --failed
   ```

   A re-run keeps the original `should-publish` decision, so it still runs even
   though the version is already live on npm. A _fresh_ dispatch would skip every
   publish leg — the workflow turns itself off when npm already has the version.

2. **Missing or mismatched trusted publisher** — create the entry, then re-run:

   ```bash
   npm login --auth-type=web
   npm trust github taglib-wasm --file publish-everywhere.yml \
     --repository CharlesWiltgen/TagLib-Wasm --allow-publish -y
   ```

   `--allow-publish` matters: entries created in the npm web UI default to
   stage-publish only, which refuses `npm publish`.

3. A failed leg writes a failure summary (with rollback commands) to the run
   summary, and no tag or release is created. A tag conflict — the version's tag
   already exists at a different commit — also fails the run instead of
   publishing a release for the wrong commit.

Registry reads lag the publish: verify a version with the immutable endpoint
(`https://registry.npmjs.org/taglib-wasm/<version>`), never `npm view` — the
packument is CDN-cached and can answer "not found" for minutes after a
successful publish.
